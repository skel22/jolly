                We are two students from Beja, Portugal who are currently in the final year of a 2-year-long course for web 
                and Android development, currently studying in ESTIG (Escola Superior de Tecnologias e Gestão) under the Instituto Politécnico
                de Beja. Our goal is to push past our difficulties and explore programming languages while applying what we have learned 
                throughout the course.

                Jolly came from the idea of the two authors of this web space, the interest in learning how a self-service application can 
                work and what the necessary steps for it to come to fruition are needed in order to have a functional app. The app itself 
                provides a menu for a fictional ice cream shop with the very same name as the application.
